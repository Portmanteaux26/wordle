Wordle clone

This is a Python 3 clone of Wordle by Josh Wardle.
Created as a learning exercise to practice control structures, function design, and dictionary usage.

Written in Python 3.12 using only built-in, platform-independent modules.
Only a local installation of Python 3.0+ is required.  Running from PowerShell recommended.
Guesses.txt and solutions.txt must be located in the same directory as wordle.py

The script will randomly generate a hidden solution word using a list of possible words (solutions.txt)
Each inputted guess will return a hint consisting of O's, X's and ?'s
Script will close upon correct guess or 6th incorrect guess.
